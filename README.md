# Machine-Learning-Projects
 A repository featuring various machine learning projects, showcasing implementations of algorithms, model training, and data analysis. I'm still new to machine learning algorithms, which is why these projects might not be extremely refined or detailed. 
 However, I'm willing to learn and make this my career as I am really passionate about machine learning.
